# modajo (MO-da-jo)
This is a project to develop a personal journal with multiple notebooks and multiple interfaces whose notebooks and fields can be set by the user.

It is built on top of a SQLite database (other databases to come later) and meant to be operated from the command line. There are plans for support of GUIs in the future, definitely web-browser and probably Android and desktop.

## Non-standard libraries used
* Flask
* Flask-SQLAlchemy
* Flask-Migrate (future additions)
* PyYAML

## Installation
