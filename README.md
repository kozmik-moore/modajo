# modajo (MO-da-jo)
This is a project to develop a personal journal with multiple notebooks and multiple interfaces whose notebooks and fields can be set by the user.

It is built on top of a SQLite database (other databases to come later) and meant to be operated from the command line and using YAML files. There are plans for support of GUIs in the future, definitely web-browser and probably Android and desktop.

## Future plans
* Support for greater variety of interfaces, especially GUIs
* Analytics and data visualizations
* Support for greater variety of databases
* Support for storing entries as plain text files, instead of using a database

## Non-standard libraries used
* Flask
* Flask-SQLAlchemy
* Flask-Migrate (future additions)
* PyYAML

## Installation
(coming soon)
